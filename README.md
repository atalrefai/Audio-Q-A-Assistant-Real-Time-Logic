 Documentation for Audio Q&A Assistant Project

 1. How to Set Up the Project from Scratch

To set up this project on a new machine, follow the steps below:

Prerequisites:
- Node.js and npm (Ensure that Node.js is installed, as npm comes with it)
- Google Cloud account with Speech-to-Text API enabled
- OpenAI API Key

Step-by-Step Setup:

1. Clone the Repository:
   Clone or download the project files from your repository.

   bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repository-url.git
   cd your-project-directory
   

2. Install Dependencies:
   Install the necessary packages for both the backend (server.js) and the frontend (App.js).

   bash
   npm install
   

   This will install required packages such as express, cors, body-parser, axios, @google-cloud/speech, mic, and openai.

3. Configure Environment Variables:
   - Create a .env file in the root directory and set the necessary environment variables.

     
     OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
     PORT=5000
     

   - Place your Google Cloud Speech-to-Text credentials in a JSON file, such as absolute-bloom-435805-c3-f759528475b9.json, and ensure that its path is correctly referenced in server.js.

4. Start the Backend Server:
   To start the server and run the backend:

   bash
   node server.js
   

   The server should start on port 5000 (or any other port specified in .env).

5. Run the Frontend:
   For the React-based frontend, run:

   bash
   npm start
   

   This will launch the frontend app where users can interact with the system.

 2. Interface Demo

The user interface for this project is a simple yet powerful audio-based Q&A assistant. Below are the main features in action:

1. Recording Audio:
   - Users can click the "Start Recording" button to begin recording their voice.
   - A "Stop Recording" button allows users to stop the recording, after which the recorded audio is uploaded for processing.

2. Displaying Transcription and Answer:
   - After stopping the recording, the audio is processed, and the transcription of the user's speech is displayed.
   - Once the transcription is obtained, the app will also fetch an answer to the question via OpenAI's API and display it below the transcription.

3. Loading Indicator:
   - A loading message (Loading, please wait...) is displayed while the audio is being processed, ensuring the user knows that the application is working.

4. Audio Playback:
   - After recording, users can replay the audio they recorded to verify the content before it's processed.

 3. Codebase Explanation

The codebase consists of two primary parts: the backend (server.js) and the frontend (App.js).

---

Backend (server.js):
- Purpose: This file handles the audio processing and transcription using Google Cloud's Speech-to-Text API and integrates OpenAI for generating answers.
- Key Parts:
  1. Speech-to-Text Setup: 
     The backend initializes the Google Cloud Speech-to-Text API using the provided credentials. The streaming API is set up to capture and transcribe the user's voice in real-time.
  2. Microphone Input: 
     The mic package is used to capture audio input from the user's microphone and feed it into the Google Cloud Speech-to-Text streaming service.
  3. Processing Transcription: 
     Once the speech transcription is complete, the backend sends the transcription to OpenAI to generate a response.
  4. OpenAI Integration: 
     The transcription is sent to OpenAI's API, where a GPT-3.5 model provides a relevant answer based on the transcription.

---

Frontend (App.js):
- Purpose: This is a React component that handles the user interaction, from recording audio to displaying transcription and the generated answer.
- Key Features:
  1. State Management:
     - The app uses useState to manage the states of recording, transcription, audio playback, and loading.
  2. Audio Recording:
     - The navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia() API is used to capture the user's microphone input, and the audio is stored in audioChunksRef.
  3. Uploading Audio:
     - After recording, the audio is converted to a Blob, which is then uploaded to the backend for transcription.
  4. Display Logic:
     - The transcription and the response from OpenAI are displayed to the user once available. A loading indicator is shown while the backend processes the request.

Technical Choices:
- React: Chosen for its ability to handle real-time updates and state management efficiently.
- Google Cloud Speech-to-Text: Selected for its high accuracy in live transcription.
- OpenAI GPT-3.5: Used for generating contextually appropriate answers based on the user's transcribed audio input.

This documentation should help in understanding how to set up and interact with the project, as well as the structure and purpose behind the codebase.
